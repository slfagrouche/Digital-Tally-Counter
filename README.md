# Digital-Tally-Counter
Digital-Tally-Counter is a Java Swing application that allows the user to keep track of any type of count. It features a user-friendly interface with a button for incrementing the count and a label for displaying the current count. The user can reset the count to zero, save the current count, and change the color and font size of the UI. The program also includes a ComboBox to select between different count types (Counter, Push-ups Count, Prayer, Other).
